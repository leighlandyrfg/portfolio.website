       <h2>About me:</h2>
       <p>Hello! Welcome to my page, my name is Leighland Wilgis! Ever since I was young I had always had a passion for art. Some of my youngest childhood memories involve me mindlessly doodling on any scrap of paper that I could find. As the years went by, I continued drawing and improving my artwork. I am an extremely focused learner and productive worker! I always aim for perfection in crafting my artwork. I am a traditional and digital based artist and experienced in using various materials and mediums of art. Openly optimistic to trying new things and working on diverse projects.</p>
        <h2>Skills:</h2>
        <p>I am experienced in using these softwares and programs: clip studio paint, procreate, photoshop.</p>
